# Rust does'nt have garbage collector
# Rust does'n allow declaring variables without a escope
# Ex:
  fn main () 
  { //init scope
     let total = 30
  } //end of escope
  //Drop

# Underscore(_) usually works for ignoring code
 - Ex 

 fn main () 
  { //init scope
     let _total = 30
  } //end of escope
